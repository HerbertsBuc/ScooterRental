# ScooterRental
The scooter rental service program is a software application that facilitates the management of scooter rentals for customers. It utilizes various tools and functionalities in C# to provide a seamless rental experience.

The program incorporates features to handle multiple aspects of the rental process, such as reservation management, inventory tracking, payment processing, and report generation. These functionalities are implemented using C# tools and libraries.

To begin the rental process, customers can make reservations through the program. The program allows them to specify the desired rental date, time, and duration. C# tools are employed to capture and process this reservation information effectively.

Upon confirming a reservation, the program automatically updates the inventory to reflect the availability of scooters during the rental period. C# tools are used to manage and manipulate the inventory data, ensuring accurate tracking of scooter availability.

At the end of the rental period, the program employs C# tools to calculate charges based on the duration of the rental and any additional fees or damages incurred during the rental period. This calculation process is implemented using appropriate C# libraries and functions.

One of the benefits of using C# in developing the scooter rental service program is the ability to incorporate unit tests. Unit tests are code snippets that verify the correctness of individual units or components of the program. By utilizing unit tests, the program can identify defects early in the development cycle, ensuring that the software functions correctly and exhibits improved overall quality.
